#### 🚀 Welcome to My New Academic Website


I'm excited to share the launch of my new **personal academic website**, built with  
[**Quarto**](https://quarto.org/){target="_blank"}, [**R**](https://www.r-project.org/){target="_blank"}, and [**GitHub**](https://github.com/){target="_blank"}.

> 💡 Curious how it's made? The full source code is available on  
[**my GitHub repository**](https://github.com/bhofstra/aca-web){target="_blank"}.

This site brings together my work in **research**, **teaching**, **media**, and **collaboration** — all in a clear, accessible format. Here’s what you’ll find:

### 👋 About
A short blurb with some of my activities and things I love.

### 📝 Research  
An up-to-date overview of my published, forthcoming, and working papers. Arguably the most important part of the website, and the one I devoted most time to. All papers have clickable links to the PDFs and many papers have clickable links to code and companion websites. 

### 🎓 Teaching
Courses I coordinate or lecture in, along with my supervision of theses and research projects. In the future I hope to include syllabi and the sorts here.

### 📰 Media  
A (hopefully) regularly updated feed with interviews, opinion pieces, and media mentions.

### 📁 News
A section with news, announcements of new publications, downloadable materials (perhaps code snippets in the future) and links for students, collaborators, and curious minds.

I wanted to move away from the Wix point and click system as it wasn't versatile for my purposes anymore. The new website is designed to be **clean**, **minimal**, **responsive**, and **scalable** and this site works seamlessly on desktop and mobile. 

Thanks for stopping by — feel free to explore, and check back soon for updates.
