    "text": "Welcome! You might have heard of me through The Diversity-Innovation Paradox in Science, though I have done a lot of cool research before, and after — with much more in the publication pipeline!\nWhat do I do? A lot! A full a accounting of my activities is found in my CV, but here are some excerpts:\nI write papers that are widely discussed — in Nature and Science. I’m invited to write about my perspective, for instance in Nature. I am a principal investigator that mentors interns, data managers, PhDs, and postdocs. I write grant proposals, sometimes successfully (NWO, NSF, ODISSEI), oftentimes not. I develop sociological theories, computational methods, and coordinate, collect, link, and enrich big data. I lead interdisciplinary, cross-national collaborations. I (am invited to) present my work around the world. I review at journals like Nature and PNAS, at disciplinary journals like American Sociological Review and American Journal of Sociology, or at subject journals like Social Networks. I am my department’s Data Steward, teach and practice Open Science, love data visualization, and am an elected member of the Radboud Young Academy. I teach and develop courses at all levels, am a member of the Educational Committee, and Test Committee, and am writing an Open Access book on network analysis with Jochem Tolsma.\nResearch dissemination is important to me, and my work is discussed nationally and internationally. I’m interviewed on national television, and radio, and in newspapers. I write popular pieces in Dutch and English.\nWhen I’m not at work, I’m play guitar and drums, read books on whatever curious topic, curate my science fiction book collection, hike, and watch movies. But my favorite pastime is spending time with my son.\nHave a look around, all PDFs of my papers are here, and you can find links to a lot of data and code. I’m planning to fill up this space with more materials: course manuals, (Quarto) presentations, code, and so forth."

    "text": "Welcome! I am a tenured Assistant Professor at Radboud University’s Department of Sociology. I got my PhD from Utrecht University’s Department of Sociology and was Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Stanford University.\nMy work orbits the study of diversity, stratification, and innovation. It captures longitudinal systems of social and cultural exchange: from the gestation and birth of networks, careers, ideas, or innovations, to their use, up until their eventual cessation. As such, I strive for three interrelated goals: (i) answering substantive questions on causes and effects of social networks, while (ii) contributing to social theory, and (iii) using computational methods and big data. My research appeared (among others) in PNAS, American Sociological Review, Social Forces, Social Networks, and Nature Human Behaviour, was honored with several grants and awards, and my work is widely discussed in Dutch and international media!"

My work on diversity, stratification, and innovation crosscuts adolescent, social media, employee, experimental, and academic networks. This helps to understand the most fundamentally human processes of making social connections and their consequences as nuanced, complete, and large-scale as possible. It also appeals to my curiosity and enables what I value most: big ideas, interdisciplinarity, and leading teams to open science.\nCheck out my work! Most of my recent papers have full replication websites under “View Code.” You can also find my work on my Google Scholar and there are many details (presentations, grants, service, etc.) on my CV"

    "text": "Thrilled to share my latest publication in the journal Social Networks, together with Beate Völker (lead), Rense Corten, and Frank van Tubergen.\nIn this paper we use computational methods (for insiders, specifically the Network Scale-Up Method) to calculate both network size and its determinants, as well as network homogeneity and its determinants. This is a project that came out of our earlier popular publication at Quest where they asked us similar questions!\nWe find fascinating patterns where average network size across a representative set of respondents in the Netherlands is about 518 people. But more importantly, it decreases with age, unemployment, lower income, lower house values, lower education, and fewer people in a household. Additionally, we find a pretty strong presence of gender and educational homogeneity.\nThese findings have important implications for Dutch social structure as to who is at risk to become socially isolated, who has less access to instrumental means, and as to where social barriers between groups exist.\nHere are the Highlights to the paper:  - The scale-up method with an exceptionally large number of items reveals extended networks of residents in the Netherlands,  - in particular, having a job and living in a large household matter for acquaintance networks, while  - the influence of other background characteristics on network size is not strong and  - extended networks are segregated according to gender and education, similar to the core networks as previously shown. \nYou can find the paper here.\nYou can find the replication website to the paper here."

    "text": "📺 RTL Nieuws EditieNL besteedde onlangs aandacht aan en interviewde mij over ons onderzoek naar de kennissenkring van Nederlanders. Samen met Beate Völker, Rense Corten, en Frank van Tubergen onderzochten we hoe groot deze netwerken zijn en hoe homogeen ze vaak blijken te zijn.\n🎤 Voor de uitzending werd ik geïnterviewd over de bevindingen en de mogelijke implicaties van die homogeniteit. Denk bijvoorbeeld aan de invloed op iemand’s wereldbeeld. Mooi om te zien dat ons onderzoek maatschappelijke relevantie heeft en een breder publiek bereikt. Dank aan RTL EditieNL voor het interessante en heldere item!\n📽️ Bekijk de reportage via deze link vanaf 7:32."
