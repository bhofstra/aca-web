You might have heard of me through [**The Diversity-Innovation Paradox in Science**](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1915378117){target=\"_blank\"}, though I have done a lot of cool research [**before**](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0003122417705656){target=\"_blank\"}, and [**after**](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/23780231221085118){target=\"_blank\"} --- with much more in the publication pipeline! \n\nWhat do I do? A lot! A full a accounting of my activities is found in [**my CV**](files/cv2025.pdf){target=\"_blank\"}, but here are some excerpts:\n\nI **write papers** that are widely discussed --- in [**Nature**](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-02130-0){target=\"_blank\"} and [**Science**](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.2020.368.6491.twil){target=\"_blank\"}. I'm **invited to write** about my perspective, for instance in [**Nature**](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00291-6){target=\"_blank\"}. I am a **principal investigator that mentors** interns, data managers, PhDs, and postdocs. I write grant proposals, sometimes successfully (NWO, NSF, ODISSEI), oftentimes not. I **develop sociological theories**, **computational methods**, and coordinate, collect, link, and enrich **big data**. I **lead** interdisciplinary, cross-national collaborations. I (am invited to) **present** my work around the world. I **review** at journals like *Nature* and *PNAS*, at disciplinary journals like *American Sociological Review* and *American Journal of Sociology*, or at subject journals like *Social Networks*. I am my department's **Data Steward**, teach and practice **Open Science**, love **data visualization**, and am an elected member of the **Radboud Young Academy**. I **teach** and **develop courses** at all levels, am a member of the **Educational Committee**, and **Test Committee**, and am [**writing an Open Access book**](https://snass.netlify.app/){target=\"_blank\"} on network analysis with [**Jochem Tolsma**](https://www.jochemtolsma.nl/){target=\"_blank\"}.\n\nResearch dissemination is important to me, and my work is discussed [**nationally**](https://www.volkskrant.nl/wetenschap/een-nederlander-kent-zo-n-568-mensen-soort-zoekt-soort-en-opleiding-is-een-bepalende-factor~b0c4390d/){target=\"_blank\"} and [**internationally**](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2020/04/16/underrepresented-scholars-outperform-majority-peers-terms-novel-research){target=\"_blank\"}. I'm interviewed on [**national television**](https://www.rtl.nl/nieuws/uitzendingen/video/8c795d92-6149-4d55-a86e-16c76c3ddfaf/aflevering-200){target=\"_blank\"}, and [**radio**](https://www.nporadio1.nl/fragmenten/focus/c9a54500-6824-4a48-9bf9-ac2722c81f93/2018-10-31-zijn-er-ook-glazen-plafonds-in-de-wetenschap){target=\"_blank\"}, and in [**newspapers**](https://www.elmundo.es/papel/futuro/2023/01/16/63c58e6efdddfff9a28b45c8.html){target=\"_blank\"}. I write popular pieces [**in Dutch**](https://www.socialevraagstukken.nl/vrienden-en-privacy-vormen-op-facebook-een-ongelukkige-combinatie/){target=\"_blank\"} and [**English**](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/blog/scientific-community-needs-constant-self-assessment-race-and-gender){target=\"_blank\"}.\n\nWhen I'm not at work, I'm play guitar and drums, read books on whatever curious topic, curate my science fiction book collection, hike, and watch movies. But my favorite pastime is spending time with my son.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nprint(\"does this work immediately?\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"does this work immediately?\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n",
