title: "Teaching"
---

I mentor across levels and am inspired by its significance. It is extremely rewarding to be involved in a students' quest to a solution to a problem, and to see it "click." I find it key to provide students with the confidence to navigate through the university, succeed on the job market, and thrive in their profession. I have a **University Teaching Qualification** ("BKO" ) and am on my Department's **Education Committee** and the **Test Committee**.
